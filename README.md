# C# Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm

This project is a Windows Forms (WinForms) application that implements the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, an optimization algorithm, in C#. It provides an interface that allows users to easily set algorithm parameters and monitor the solution process through graphs and detailed outputs.

### Features

* **Parameter Configuration:** Allows users to define algorithm parameters such as colony size, search bounds (lower and upper limits), trial count, and cycle count.
* **Real-Time Observation:** Displays the `fx`, `x1`, and `x2` values in real-time as the algorithm runs.
* **Graphical Visualization:** Presents two different graphs, `Fx Graph` and `X1 and X2 Graph`, to show the progress of the solution.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and clear graphical user interface (GUI) developed using WinForms.

### How It Works

1.  The application uses the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to solve an optimization problem.
2.  Users set the algorithm's parameters using the input fields in the GUI.
3.  Clicking the **"Hesapla"** (Calculate) button runs the algorithm with the specified parameters.
4.  The fitness value (`fit`) and the `x1`, `x2` coordinates of the solution are displayed in the list on the right, while the convergence of the algorithm is shown in the graphs.
